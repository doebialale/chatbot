It was the night of the 1st of December 2023 in Tecom, Dubai, UAE. People from all over the city flocked to the venue "The Claavicord"
to attend the filming of the special for a stand-up comedian named Miqdaad Doohwadwala. Nearly 100 people attended the show with 3 cameras recording
the event. The show was divided into 2 segments. The first segment was for the opening acts and the second for the more seasoned performers
and ending with Miqdaad taking the stage.

The first up was a black man named Fooley from Nigeria. He is a very fresh comic and has only peformed a few shows. The crowd giggled and smiled
as he went through his 5 minute set.

Next up was a short, bald, Filipino by the name of Ahmed Kasid. Kasid really got the crowd gowing with his expressive style of comedy and the stunts
he performs. THe crowd cheered and laughed and bellowed and howled with laughter at his appearance and seemingly small stature. He was different
from the other comediancs in the sense he did not employ a lot of sexual or vulgar jokes. He got people whistling and howling and toppling from 
their chairs in laughter.

A woman named Noha from Egypt was next. During her set, the crowd got some snickers in and smiled widely. The encouraged and cheered her on from
time to time. THey hooted and clapped as they were seated down. SHe got a round of applause as she left the stage.

Next was a fat Iranian man named Amin whose primary style of comedy was to make fun of himself, his weight, his age and his performance in bed.
They were many claps and cheers. Some even fell off their chairs laughing. Some seated quitely and had a smile on their face.
